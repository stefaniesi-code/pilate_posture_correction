# pilate_posture_correction
This project analyzes body mechanics to detect common posture faults (like spinal flexion/extension errors) and helps users achieve optimal form during their workout.

A true digital alignment coach.

AI Pilates Posture Correction (PPC)
PPC is an AI-powered system that leverages computer vision and real-time pose estimation to analyze and correct human movement and posture, specifically targeting exercises common in Pilates and core stabilization training.

Many injuries during exercise stem from poor form and a lack of awareness of spinal neutral position. 
This project acts as a digital physical therapist, providing objective, immediate feedback to ensure safer, more effective workouts.



Technology Stack: 
- Component	Purpose 
- Python	Core language for logic and processing. 
- OpenCV	Computer vision utilities and camera feed management. 
- Pose Estimation Library	Deep learning framework (e.g., Mediapipe, OpenPose, or custom model) for identifying 3D anatomical landmarks. 
- NumPy/Pandas	Data processing, storage, and feature engineering (calculating joint angles).
